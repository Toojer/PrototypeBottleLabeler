# PrototypeBottleLabeler
Initial design for the honey bottle label dispenser.  

Need to install Arduino IDE (2.3.6 used in the original build)
  Install the following packages inside of the Arduino IDE: 
    * AccelStepper
    Install the packages exactly how they are spelled.  There are other packages that may be similar in name, but the packages are case sensitive.

Using Arduino UNO R3 from about 2013.  Works fine in initial build.  Can't imagine a newer Arduino R3 would be any different.
